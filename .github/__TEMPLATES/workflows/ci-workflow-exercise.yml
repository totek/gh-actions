## This workflow shows how to use conditional executions on context
##
## Exercise Goal:
## The workflow below contains intentional mistakes or missing logic.
## Your task is to fix it so that:
##
## ✅ Jobs run only on the appropriate branches
## ✅ Each job runs in the correct order using 'needs'
## ✅ Conditional logic is used with the correct GitHub context values
## ✅ CVE scanning runs on main, feature/* and bugfix/* branches only
## ✅ Deployment runs ONLY on the main branch, and only after a successful CVE scan
